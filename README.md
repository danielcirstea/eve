                    <h4>1. What is EVE ?</h4>
                    <p>
                        EVE stands for E-learning Virtual Environment and its purpose is making sure that
                        there is an easy way to manage courses between teachers and students. It has been
                        developed with the idea that it might replace some other e-learning platforms some day.
                    </p>
                    <h4>2. General guidelines</h4>
                    <h5>2.1 When firstly accessing the platform</h5>
                    <p> If you are here, that means you already found how the left top menu works. There are
                        only these two options: "Guide" and "About". You picked guide and ended up here. The about
                        page also describes some general information about the web application for the curious ones.
                        On the right top corner if you click on that plain avatar, you may log in or sign up (same
                        as in the center of the home page) or if you forgot your password, you may reset it. Pretty
                        straight forward.</p>
                    <h5>2.2 Using the platform as a student</h5>
                    <p> Welcome, brave student. The process of signing up is easy and requires some of your data. Just
                        use the sign up buttons on top right corner or from the main page and create your account,
                        you will need to fill in all fields, given an absolutely unique student ID that belongs only
                        to you. Initially the app is build to use the ISIC student ID, but the University may change
                        that
                        as desired. After signing up successfully, you will be redirected to main page. Again, on the
                        top
                        left corner you will see a new option called "My Courses" which will redirect you to the courses
                        your teachers added you to. Also from the other menu you can change details about your profile
                        by using the "Edit Profile" option or by accessing the "Courses" option you can check all
                        courses
                        for all faculties but not be able to see the content if a teacher didn't add you.
                        Once you access a course, information will be displayed about it on the left panel (or top, if
                        you are on a mobile device) and on the other panel you will be able to see the courses content
                        (if you are enrolled to that course) and check the information teacher uploaded to you. Good
                        luck!</p>
                    <h5>2.3 Using the platform as a teacher</h5>
                    <p>
                        For a teacher, the process is similar to above. You need a teacher ID that is unique and
                        absolutely unique that belongs to you in order to sign up. Then you will see on the left top
                        menu a new option called "Classroom" which represents the main teacher control panel which
                        contains the following options: visualizing your courses and enrolling or disenrolling students,
                        adding a lecture, removing a lecture, creating notifications, deleting notifications,
                        creating student uploads and closing them or re-enabling a student to upload files again.
                        And on right top menu you will find the courses page as well, and may check those courses
                        as well.
                    </p>
                    <h4>3. F.A.Q.</h4>
                    <h5>3.1 From where do I get my student/teacher ID ?</h5>
                    <p> As mentioned above the app should use the ISIC student ID or ITIC teacher ID which both are
                        unique,
                        but if the institution decided to change that ID to something else, then the University staff or
                        a supervizor might be able to provide you the required information. </p>
                    <h5>3.2 I lost my password or username. What do I do ?</h5>
                    <p> In case you lost/forgot your password you can recover it very easy. From the main page
                    you can find a "Forgot your password?" option in the log in form, or in the corner right top menu.
                    From there, just enter your e-mail and then the system will send you a reset link that you can use
                    to make a new password.
                          In case you forgot your username, talk to a supervizor. Because of security purposes, once you
                    made a username you may not be able to change it.</p>
                    <h5>3.3 I cannot see lectures for a course.</h5>
                    <p> There are two options: either the teacher did not add you to his course, either teacher added you
                    but he didn't post any lectures content yet.</p>
                    <h5>3.4 Why so much information is needed to sign up ?</h5>
                    <p> That is self understandable. Firstly, because of security purposes. All that information is stored
                    and verified by some University staff. Secondly, all that information like phone, profile picture, email
                    may make things a lot easier for the staff to send you information and keep you updated, as well as
                    keeping track of the students information much easier.</p>
                    <h5>3.5 How do I submit a file ?</h5>
                  <p> As a student you may submit a file into a course, only if the teacher allowed you to do it. Simply you
                    can go the course page and upload the required a file and add a comment like "Project 1.1" and then the
                    teacher will evaluate it. A teacher may also re-enable the file submission for a specific student if
                    anything happens.</p>
